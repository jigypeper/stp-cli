# Technical Design Report: PythonOCC Intersection Tool

## Overview and Requirements

This project implements a tool for finding intersections between 3D geometry in STEP files and user-defined planes. The core requirement was to use PythonOCC (Python OpenCASCADE) for geometry handling, which significantly influenced my technical decisions, particularly around environment management.

## Design Decisions

### Environment Management

Given PythonOCC's unavailability on PyPI, I chose conda for environment management. While I would have preferred using modern Python package managers like `uv`, conda was necessary to handle PythonOCC's complex dependencies. I created a comprehensive `environment.yml` to ensure reproducibility:

```yaml
name: pyoccenv
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - pytest=8.3.4
  - pythonocc-core=7.8.1.1
  # ...other dependencies
```

### CLI Implementation

I selected `typer` for the command-line interface because it offers:
- Type safety through Python type hints
- Automatic help text generation
- Clean argument parsing with minimal boilerplate
- Easy error handling

This allowed me to focus on the core geometry processing while maintaining a professional CLI interface.

### Code Structure

I split the implementation into distinct components:
- `main.py`: CLI handling and program flow
- `model_fns.py`: Core geometry operations
- Separate test files for each module

This separation allows independent testing of geometry operations, while making the code more maintainable.

## Testing Strategy

Testing was a primary concern given the complexity of geometric operations. I used pytest for its:
- Fixture support for test setup/cleanup
- Clear test organization
- Built-in assertion framework

Key testing decisions:
1. Created fixtures for STEP file loading to avoid redundancy
2. Implemented cleanup fixtures to manage test output files
3. Thoroughly tested error conditions (invalid files, zero vectors, etc.)
4. Added validation tests for intersection points

Example test structure:
```python
def test_plane_intersects_creates_file(step_model, cleanup_output):
    plane_coords = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
    success, points = read_plane(step_model, plane_coords, cleanup_output)
    assert success is True
    assert len(points) > 0
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: Large STEP files are loaded entirely into memory
2. **Error Handling**: Basic status codes could be enhanced with detailed error information
3. **Validation**: Limited geometric validation before processing

### Potential Improvements

In order of priority:

1. **High Priority**
   - Add logging for debugging complex geometries
   - Implement more robust geometry validation
   - Add integration tests with complex STEP files

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Convert error codes to Enum for type safety
   - Add progress reporting for large files
   - Improve error messages

3. **Future Considerations**
   - Streaming processing for large files
   - Caching for repeated operations
   - Performance benchmarks

## Conclusion

My implementation prioritizes testability while meeting the core requirement of using PythonOCC. The design choices reflect the constraints of the problem space (particularly around dependency management) while maintaining good software engineering practices.

The modular structure and comprehensive test suite demonstrate my understanding of technical trade-offs and the importance of maintainable code. While there are areas for improvement, the current implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

I initially spent a large amount of time trying to compile everything on an Arch Linux machine, but was forced to work on a newer laptop, though I still faced trouble getting it working. Personally, I think think the documentation for the python wrapper is lacking, in my opinion, it should be readily available in the project repository.
