# Technical Design Report: CadQuery Intersection Tool

## Overview and Requirements

This project implements a tool for finding intersections between 3D geometry in STEP files and user-defined planes. The core requirement was to transition from PythonOCC to CadQuery, which significantly influenced the technical design decisions.

## Design Decisions

### Package Management

With the move to CadQuery, I embraced `uv` as the package manager, addressing previous limitations with conda. This modern Python package management solution offers:
- Faster dependency resolution
- Simpler virtual environment management
- Improved reproducibility

Dependencies are now managed through a `pyproject.toml`:
```
cadquery==2.5.2
typer==0.15.1
pytest==8.3.4
pyqt5==5.15.9
```

### Library Transition

Switching from PythonOCC to CadQuery brought several advantages:
- More Pythonic API
- Simpler geometric operations
- Better documentation
- Easier installation process

The core intersection detection was simplified significantly, moving from complex projection and intersection calculations to a straightforward split-based approach.

### CLI Implementation

Maintained `typer` for command-line interface, preserving:
- Type safety through Python type hints
- Automatic help text generation
- Clean argument parsing
- Easy error handling

### Code Structure

Retained the modular approach:
- `main.py`: CLI handling and program flow
- `model_fns.py`: Core geometry operations
- Separate test files for each module

## Testing Strategy

Continued using pytest, maintaining the previous testing philosophy:
- Fixture support for test setup/cleanup
- Clear test organization
- Comprehensive assertion framework

Key testing modifications:
1. Updated tests to work with CadQuery's API
2. Verified intersection detection across various geometric configurations
3. Maintained error condition tests

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Geometry Complexity**: Intersection detection may vary with complex models
2. **Performance**: Large STEP files might still have memory usage concerns
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error reporting could be enhanced

### Potential Improvements

1. **High Priority**
   - Implement advanced logging
   - Add more detailed geometric validation
   - Create integration tests with diverse STEP files

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Enhance error message specificity
   - Add performance benchmarking
   - Implement more robust file handling

3. **Future Considerations**
   - Support for additional CAD file formats
   - Streaming processing for large files
   - Advanced geometric analysis features

## Results and Performance Analysis

### Test Case 1: Mid-Height Angled Intersection
- Point: (0.0, 0.0, 100.0)
- Normal vector: (0.2, 0.1, 1.0)
- Result: Intersection points detected (94 of them)

### Test Case 2: Side Plane Configuration
- Point: (300.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- Normal vector: (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- Result: No intersections detected

## Conclusion

The transition to CadQuery represents a significant improvement in the project's architecture. By leveraging a more modern and Pythonic library, we've simplified the geometric intersection logic while maintaining robust functionality.

Key benefits of the transition include:
- Simplified code complexity
- More intuitive geometric operations
- Easier dependency management
- Improved maintainability

The use of `uv` for package management addresses previous challenges with conda, providing a more streamlined development experience. This approach demonstrates the importance of continually evaluating and updating technical stacks to leverage emerging tools and libraries.

Future development will focus on expanding the tool's capabilities, improving performance, and enhancing error handling and reporting. The modular design provides a solid foundation for ongoing improvements and potential extensions to support more advanced geometric analysis.
